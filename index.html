		<h1>Welcome to Henry's Homepage</h1>
		<p>Hello, my name is Henry Wilkinson, I am a student at CSUMB and am a Communication Design major with a focus on visual design.
			I enjoy things like video games and drawing, I currently have 3 dogs and a cat,
			I love to listen to music all the time to fill the empty air and stop any anxious thoughts.
			I hope to learn how to use java script to animate and model objects in html.
			I have always had an interest in 3d art and hope to learn somethings about it in html.</p>
		<p>If you would like to reach me</p>
